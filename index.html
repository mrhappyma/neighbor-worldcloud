    <h3> Summary </h3>
    <br>
    <p> I chose an outstretched hand for the shape for my wordcloud. I think that an outstretched hand ospecially connects to neighbor with the story of the good samaritan examle. It symbolizes the samaritan stretching out his hand to help up the man lying on the ground. </p>
